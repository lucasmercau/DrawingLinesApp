# Overview

This project is a console-based task manager application developed in Kotlin. The primary objective of this software is to provide a practical demonstration of various Kotlin language features. I created this program using IntelliJ IDEA. This project serves as a learning tool to understand Kotlin's syntax and features more deeply.

The task manager application that I created allows users to add, remove, list, and mark tasks as completed, as well as filter tasks by their completion status. Making it a really useful application to use and to help you complete different tasks.
